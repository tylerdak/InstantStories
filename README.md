Instant Stories is a MadLibs-style story maker. It's almost as easy to write story templates for this program as it is to fill them in with the program!

## Story Formatting
To create a story template, simply create a .txt file where you will write your story. To make variables, simply put the category in between {curly braces}, making sure to replace any spaces with underscores in those braces.

Example:
>The {ADJECTIVE} fox {past_tense_Verb} over the {ADJECTIVE} {NOUN}.

Notice how "past tense Verb" is instead typed as "past_tense_Verb". This is completely necessary and the program will crash with normal spacing. Also take note that the capitalization is completely up to the writer. The categories are presented exactly as they are typed, minus the curly braces.

### Dependencies
You will need tkinter to run this. Installing tkinter can vary based on the operating system. For macOS, I installed it with homebrew.
>`brew install tk-tcl`
